# MatConvNet: CNNs for MATLAB

**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural
Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,
efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several
example CNNs are included to classify and encode images. Please visit
the [homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to know more.

In case of compilation issues, please read first the
[Installation](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/) and
[FAQ](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/faq/) section before creating an GitHub
issue. For general inquiries regarding network design and training
related questions, please use the
