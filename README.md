# Deep Hashing Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

In this work we propose a novel deep learning framework that can exploit 
labeled source data and unlabeled target data to learn informative hash codes 
to accurately classify unseen target data. To the best of our knowlege this 
is the first  research effort to exploit the feature learning capabilities 
of deep neural networks to learn representative hash codes to address the 
domain adaptation problem. 

We also introduce a new object recognition dataset **[Office-Home](https://hemanthdv.github.io/officehome-dataset/)** 
for domain adaptation.

The deep learning code is based off **MatConvNet** - a MATLAB toolbox 
implementing *Convolutional Neural Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision 
applications. Check out [homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to know more.
