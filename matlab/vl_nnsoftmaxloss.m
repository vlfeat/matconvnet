function Y = vl_nnsoftmaxloss(X,c,dzdy)
% VL_NNSOFTMAXLOSS  CNN combined softmax and logistic loss
%    Y = VL_NNSOFTMAX(X, C) applies the softmax operator followed by
%    the logistic loss the data X. X has dimension H x W x D x N,
%    packing N arrays of W x H D-dimensional vectors.
%
%    C contains the class labels, which should be integer in the range
%    1 to D.  C can be an array with either N elements or with H x W x
%    1 x N dimensions. In the fist case, a given class label is
%    applied at all spatial locations; in the second case, different
%    class labels can be specified for different locations.
%
%    D can be thought of as the number of possible classes and the
%    function computes the softmax along the D dimension. Often W=H=1,
%    but this is not a requirement, as the operator is applied
%    convolutionally at all spatial locations.
%
%    DZDX = VL_NNSOFTMAXLOSS(X, C, DZDY) computes the derivative DZDX
%    of the CNN output Z with respect to the input X given the derivative DZDY
%    with respect to the block output Y. DZDX has the same dimension
%    as X.
